\section{Implementation}

Our implementation of the Gaussian Graphical Model (GGM) is shown below in \cref{lst:den}.

One example output is:

\begin{verbatim}
Parameters: noise 0.15, sigma 1.0, alpha -1.0, gamma 1.0
Fancy Q built in 21.59257435798645
Solved for color 0 in 3.752129316329956
Solved for color 1 in 3.723545789718628
Solved for color 2 in 3.754192352294922
Time from loading image to denoised image: 33.608970403671265
Quality of the denoising: 54.8355275322
\end{verbatim}

The time is given in seconds. The measure for quality is the \code{numpy.linalg.norm} between the denoised and the original image.
In \cref{fig:ex} the images corresponding to the output are shown.

  \caption{From left to right the pictures show: the original image, the noisy image, the denoised image.}
  \label{fig:ex}
\end{figure}

By varying the parameters \code{noise}, \code{sigma}, \code{alpha} and \code{gamma} we can evaluate their effect on the results.

Obviously, a stronger noise leads to worse results. An option which we haven't tried yet, is to rerun the algorithm on the result to improve the denoising.

\section{Comparison}

We compared our algorithm to some of the algorithms available on ipol.im.

In particular we used the \emph{Non-Local Means Denoising} to do a qualitative comparision. For that we used their program to first produce a noisy image which we denoised with both their and our algorithm. The resulting images are shown in \cref{fig:den}. Then we used their program \emph{img\_mse\_ipol} to calculate the RMSE and the PSNR. The results are shown in \cref{tab:rmse}. The better denoising has a smaller RMSE and larger PSNR value.

In \cref{fig:diff} we have computed the differences to the original picture using \emph{img\_diff\_ipol}.

We can see that the GGM is still far from achieving the results of the \emph{nlmeans} algorithm. In particular the GGM can't detect large areas of uniform color since it only compares neighboring pixels.

  \begin{tabular}{l | r | r}
          & GGM   & nlmeans \\
    \hline
    RMSE  & 13.66 & 8.00    \\
    PSNR  & 25.42 & 30.07
  \end{tabular}

\end{table}
